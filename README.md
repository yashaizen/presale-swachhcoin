# SwachhCoin PreSale Repository


**Base Problem**
- [x] Capturing live value from CMC through ticker symbol
- [ ] Use of Ajax or a New Page Pop up to display the dynamically generated 'No. Of Tokens'
- [ ] Basic Design UI
- [ ] Structure of flow inside the form


**USAGE**   
[1]. in `save` we have to define the ticker of the coin as `coin.TICKER.name`     
[2]. `cviu` gives value of the coin in usd.     
[3]  `amountx` is the amount of coin.   
[4]   **bug** :  `swachhtokensx` returns 'NaN' during running. However doing the same thing works in the console   
[5] `swachhtokensx` gives the net amount of tokens.   

**bug** has been highlighted in usage
